You're asking a great question that clarifies the target for the update! The good news is that the workflow I provided earlier is already well-suited for this scenario, with a small clarification on how you'd use the "template" concept with it.

Here's how it aligns and if any (minor) conceptual adjustments are needed:

**Understanding "Using a Template" in Notion for this Workflow:**

When you say you want to use a template that has a single field to update, in the context of an automated workflow, this typically means:

1.  **You have a Notion page (the "instance") that was *created from* or *based on* a template.** This template defined the structure, including the specific field (let's call it a "property" in Notion terms) where the Chromium version should go.
2.  **Your workflow will update this *specific page instance*, not the template definition itself.** Templates are blueprints; you update the houses built from the blueprints, not the blueprint itself every time a new piece of information comes in.

**How the Previous Workflow Handles This (No Major Code Changes Needed):**

The Drone CI workflow provided earlier is designed to:

1.  Fetch the Chromium version using your `secret/get-chromium-version` container.
2.  Write this version to a file (`chromium_version.txt`) in the shared workspace.
3.  Use a Python script to:
    * Read the version from the file.
    * Make an API call to Notion to **update a specific page** identified by `NOTION_PAGE_ID`.
    * Within that page, it updates a **specific property** (your "single field") identified by `NOTION_PROPERTY_NAME`.

**The relevant part of the Python script in the previous `.drone.yml` was:**

```python
# ... (imports and variable loading) ...

update_payload = {
    "properties": {
        PROPERTY_NAME: { # This is your "single field" from the template
            "rich_text": [
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "text": {
                        "content": CHROMIUM_VERSION
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}

api_url = f"https://api.notion.com/v1/pages/{PAGE_ID}" # PAGE_ID is the instance of your template
response = requests.patch(api_url, headers=headers, json=update_payload)

# ... (error handling) ...
```

**What This Means for Your "Template with a Single Field":**

* **`NOTION_PAGE_ID` Secret:** This secret in your Drone CI settings will be the ID of the *actual Notion page instance* that you want to update. This page would have been initially created (perhaps manually, perhaps through another process) using your desired Notion template.
* **`NOTION_PROPERTY_NAME` Secret:** This secret will be the exact name of the "single field" (i.e., the property) on that page instance where the Chromium version should be written. This field name would be defined in your template. For example, if your template has a Text property called "Latest Chromium Version", then `NOTION_PROPERTY_NAME` would be `"Latest Chromium Version"`.

**No Changes Needed to the Workflow Logic If:**

* You are always updating the **same, pre-existing Notion page instance** (that was built from your template).
* The "single field" is a standard Notion property (like Text, Rich Text, Title, etc.) on that page.

**When Would Modifications Be Needed (Less Likely for Your Stated Goal)?**

* **If you wanted to create a *new page from a template* every time the workflow runs:** This would be a different use case. The Notion API call would change from `PATCH /v1/pages/{page_id}` (update) to `POST /v1/pages` (create). You'd also need to handle how Notion's API creates pages from database templates (it usually uses the default template for a database if one is set when you create a page within that database). This doesn't seem to be what you're asking for when you say "update" a field.
* **If the "single field" is not a standard page property but, for instance, specific text content within a block:** The Python script would need to be more complex, potentially fetching the page's block content, finding the specific block, and then updating its content. This is more involved than updating a page property.

**Conclusion:**

The workflow I provided earlier is already set up to target a specific field (property) on a specific page. The fact that this page originates from a Notion template simply means that its structure and the existence of that field are predefined by your template.

**You just need to ensure:**

1.  You have a Notion page instance (created from your template).
2.  You obtain the **Page ID** of this instance and set it as the `notion_page_id` secret.
3.  You identify the **exact name of the property** (your "single field") on that page that needs updating and set it as the `notion_property_name` secret.

The existing script will then correctly update that field on your chosen page instance. The "template" nature of the page defines *what* field is available to update.

Yes, Notion absolutely allows you to create, store, and use template pages directly within Notion itself. You do not need to store them somewhere else.

Notion has a powerful built-in templating system that works in a few ways:

1.  **Page Templates via the Template Button:** You can create a "Template Button" block on any page. This button, when clicked, will generate a pre-defined block of content, which can be as simple as a few lines of text or as complex as an entire page structure with headings, databases, and more. You configure the template content directly when setting up the button.
2.  **Database Templates:** This is a very common and powerful feature. For any database in Notion (e.g., a table, list, board, calendar, gallery), you can create one or more templates for new entries.
    * When you create a new item in that database, you can choose from the templates you've defined, or set a default template to be applied automatically.
    * These templates can pre-fill properties, and also define the entire page content structure within that new database item.
    * You create and edit these database templates directly within the database's menu (usually a dropdown arrow next to the "New" button).
3.  **Duplicating Pages:** While not a "template" in the automated sense, you can easily duplicate any existing Notion page. This allows you to use any page as a starting point for a new one, effectively acting as a manual template.
4.  **Notion's Template Gallery:** Notion also provides a gallery of pre-built templates for various use cases (e.g., project management, note-taking, habit tracking) that you can duplicate into your own workspace and then customize.

**Key advantages of Notion's internal templating:**

* **Convenience:** Templates are stored and accessed right where you need them.
* **Dynamic Content (in some cases):** Database templates can include pre-filled properties and layouts.
* **Consistency:** Ensures new pages or database entries follow a standard format.
* **Efficiency:** Saves time by not having to recreate common structures repeatedly.

So, to directly answer your question: you can definitely store your page templates within Notion itself. There's no need for external storage for this purpose.
Yes, Notion absolutely allows you to create, store, and use template pages directly within Notion itself. You do not need to store them somewhere else to use them within your own workspace.

Here's how it generally works:

1.  **Creating Templates:**
    * **Database Templates:** This is the most common and powerful way. When you have a database (like a table, list, board, calendar, or gallery), you can create "template" entries for it.
        * You design a page structure once (including properties, page content, headings, to-do lists, embedded blocks, etc.).
        * When you add a new item to that database, you can choose to start from one of your saved templates, and it will pre-populate the new page with your defined structure and content.
        * You can even set a default template for a database, so every new page automatically uses it.
        * Database templates can also be set to repeat on a schedule (e.g., a daily meeting notes template).
    * **Template Buttons:** For more general use outside of databases, or to insert a predefined set of blocks onto any page, you can use the "Template Button" block (`/button` or `/template button`).
        * You configure the button by dragging and dropping any blocks (text, images, to-dos, even entire page layouts) into the template button's configuration.
        * When you click the button, it will generate a fresh copy of those blocks wherever the button is placed.

2.  **Storing Templates:**
    * **Database Templates:** These are stored directly within the specific database they are created for. They appear in the dropdown menu when you click the arrow next to the "New" button in a database.
    * **Template Buttons:** These are stored as a block on the page where you create them. You can copy and paste this button to other pages if needed.
    * **Dedicated "Templates" Page/Database:** Many users create a specific page or even a database in their workspace called "My Templates" or similar. They then store links to their most-used template pages or house their main template buttons there for easy access and organization.

3.  **Using Templates:**
    * **Database Templates:** When creating a new page in a database, you'll be prompted to choose a template (if any are defined) or start with a blank page.
    * **Template Buttons:** Simply click the button to generate the content.
    * **Duplicating Pages:** Any Notion page can effectively be used as a template by simply duplicating it. You can keep a "master" version of a page and duplicate it whenever you need a new instance.

4.  **Sharing Templates:**
    * You can share any Notion page publicly and enable the "Allow duplicate as template" option. This allows others to copy your page structure into their own workspace.
    * Notion also has a public [Template Gallery](https://www.notion.so/templates) where users can find and submit templates.

**In summary:**

Notion has robust built-in functionality for creating, storing, and using templates. You don't need an external system for managing templates you intend to use within your Notion workspace. They are an integral part of how Notion helps users streamline workflows and maintain consistency.
